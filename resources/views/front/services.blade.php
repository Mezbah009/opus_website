                        digital assistants or mobile phones.Mobile application development is the set of processes and
                        procedures involved in writing software for small, wireless computing devices such as Smartphone
                        or tablets. Mobile application development is similar to Web application development and has its

                    <p>One critical difference, however, is that mobile applications (apps) are often written
                        specifically to take advantage of the unique features a particular mobile device offers. For
                        instance, a gaming app might be written to take advantage of the iPhone's accelerator. One way
                        to ensure that applications show optimum performance on a given device is to develop the
                        application (app) natively on that device. This means that at a very low level, the code is
                        written specifically for the processor in a particular device. When an app needs to run on
                        multiple operating systems, however, there is little -- if any -- code that can be reused from
                        the initial development. The application must essentially be rewritten for each specific device.

                Business intelligence (BI) comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data
                analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of
                business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online
                analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business
                performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. BI
                technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify,
                develop and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy
                interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy
                based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.

                It can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to
                strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business
                decisions involve priorities, goals and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most
                effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with
                data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal
                data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect,
                creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data. Amongst myriad uses,
                business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and
                suitability of products and services for different market segments and to gauge the impact of marketing
                efforts.

                Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by
                machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer
                science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its
                environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
                Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions
                that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring
                "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to
                the quip, "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."For instance, optical character recognition is
                frequently excluded from "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.Capabilities
                generally classified as AI as of 2017 include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the
                highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomous cars, intelligent routing in
                content delivery network and military simulations.

            <br>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has
                experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an
                "AI winter"),followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI
                research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.These sub-fields
                are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine
                learning"),the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical
                differences. Subfields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of
                particular researchers).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances
                in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become
                an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer
                science.

                        blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new
                        transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every
                        participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as
                        Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are
                        recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash</p>

                        it dates back to at least 1981. Outsourcing sometimes, though not always, involves transferring
                        employees and assets from one firm to another. Outsourcing is also the practice of handing over

                    <p>A process consultant is a highly qualified professional that has insights into and understands
                        the psychosocial dynamics of working with various client systems such as whole organizations,
                        groups, and individuals.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Given the complex nature of intervening, a process consultant's expertise includes the following

                <h4>Re-engineering & Migration</h4>
                <p>In an ever-changing business environment, every technology is likely to become obsolete sooner or
                    later as more advanced technologies become available. Reengineering and migration enable business
                    enterprises to move ahead of old company legacy systems and leverage on the benefits of
                    state-of-the-art technologies.</p>

                <h4>Challenges: Transition Inevitable</h4>
                <p>Flexibility in the business world is much more than the implementation of advanced technologies or
                    the integration of applications and databases with a Web interface. The transition from an existing
                    system to a new system is a demanding and challenging process. Not only does it imply the
                    convergence of technologies or streamlining of business functions, but also ensures that the synergy
                    enhances the scope for overall growth and progress.</p>

                            Digital Marketing is any form of creating awareness or promoting products or services that

                            offline. Offline is any media channels that aren’t connected to the internet. These channels
                            include billboards, television ads, telemarketing, radio, print advertising, signs, and
                            pamphlets. In this article, I will be focusing on online marketing because offline marketing
                            is no more functioning as it used to be. Online marketing is the future now. Let’s take a
                            tour and discuss some of the areas of online marketing that will give us a clear overview of
                            the online world.
